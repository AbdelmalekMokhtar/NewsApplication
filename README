NewsApp is an Android application that allows users to fetch and display the latest news articles. 
The app is built using modern Android development best practices, including Dependency Injection (with Dagger Hilt), Retrofit for networking, and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.

Features Latest News: Fetches the latest news articles from a remote API using Retrofit. MVVM Architecture: Clean separation of concerns with the use of the MVVM pattern. Dependency Injection: Simplifies dependency management using Dagger Hilt. LiveData: Observes data changes and updates the UI in real-time. Coroutines: Handles asynchronous tasks efficiently with Kotlin Coroutines. Screenshots

Architecture Overview The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern, which ensures a clear separation between the UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model).

Model: Contains data classes and repository. The repository handles data operations and abstracts the data source (e.g., remote API, local database).

ViewModel: Provides data to the UI and acts as a bridge between the Model and View. It also handles user interactions and updates the UI using LiveData.

View: The UI components, typically Activities or Fragments, that observe the ViewModel's LiveData and update the UI accordingly.

Technologies Used Dagger Hilt: For Dependency Injection, making the app modular and testable. Retrofit: For making network requests to fetch news data from a REST API. Gson: For JSON parsing, used by Retrofit to deserialize the API responses. Kotlin Coroutines: For background processing and handling asynchronous tasks. LiveData: For observing data changes and updating the UI. Jetpack Compose (Optional): If youâ€™re using Jetpack Compose for the UI layer.
